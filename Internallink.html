  <p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn. At or around the summer solstice (about 3 days before Midsummer Day), the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. </p>

  <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. </p>

  <p>The Rainy Season or more formally addressed as the monsoon season reaches India around the mid of June and stays until late august/early September. This season is primarily categorized by heavy incessant rainfall and humid conditions. Despite the prevalence of humidity, the cool showers bring much-needed respite from the scorching sun.</p>
